# ComputerVision-Project

**Project Overview**
This project implements Fourier Transform-based techniques to process images in the frequency domain. By transforming images from spatial to frequency representation, we can perform advanced manipulations like noise removal, edge enhancement, and compression that are difficult to achieve in the spatial domain alone.

**Methodology**
- Frequency Domain Transformation: Applied 2D Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) and Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to convert images from spatial to frequency domain, visualizing magnitude and phase spectra.
- Frequency Filter Design & Implementation: Created and applied various frequency-domain filters including low-pass (for noise reduction), high-pass (for edge enhancement), and band-pass filters (for selective frequency manipulation).
- Practical Application Development: Implemented real-world applications including image denoising, edge detection, feature enhancement, and compression by retaining significant frequency components.
- Performance Analysis & Comparison: Evaluated filtering techniques using quantitative metrics (PSNR, SSIM) and compared frequency-domain versus spatial-domain approaches for effectiveness and efficiency.

**Tools & Technologies**
- Programming Language: Python
- Libraries: NumPy, OpenCV, Matplotlib (Python)

**Expected Outcome**
- Comprehensive understanding of frequency domain analysis principles
- Hands-on experience with Fourier transform-based image manipulation
- Practical implementation of denoising, enhancement, and compression techniques
- Quantitative evaluation of different filtering approaches
